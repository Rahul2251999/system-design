                            <h2>High-Level Architecture</h2>
                            <p>Netflix's architecture is highly distributed and cloud-based, primarily running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture can be divided into several key components:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Client Applications</h3>
                            <p>Netflix supports a wide range of client devices, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Smart TVs and streaming devices (Roku, Apple TV, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox)</li>
                                <li>Mobile devices (iOS, Android)</li>
                                <li>Web browsers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Each client type has its own application optimized for the specific platform, but they all communicate with the same backend services.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Frontend Services</h3>
                            <p>These services handle user interactions and content discovery:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Entry point for client requests, handling authentication, request routing, and protocol translation.</li>
                                <li><strong>User Interface Service</strong>: Generates and delivers the user interface elements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Search and Discovery Service</strong>: Enables content search and browsing functionality.</li>

                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Backend Services</h3>
                            <p>These services handle the core business logic:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>User Service</strong>: Manages user accounts, profiles, and authentication.</li>
                                <li><strong>Content Metadata Service</strong>: Stores and manages metadata about movies and TV shows.</li>

                            <h3>Content Delivery</h3>
                            <p>This is perhaps the most critical part of Netflix's architecture:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Content Preparation</strong>: Processes raw content into various formats and quality levels.</li>
                                <li><strong>Content Storage</strong>: Stores encoded content in AWS S3.</li>
                                <li><strong>Open Connect</strong>: Netflix's custom Content Delivery Network (CDN) with servers placed strategically within ISP networks worldwide.</li>
                                <li><strong>Streaming Service</strong>: Manages the actual video streaming process, including adaptive bitrate selection.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Data Platform</h3>
                            <p>Netflix relies heavily on data for decision-making:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gathers data from user interactions, content performance, and system operations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: Processes and analyzes the collected data using big data technologies.</li>
                                <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Powers recommendations, content decisions, and operational optimizations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>

                        <section class="content-section">
                            <h2>Key Components Deep Dive</h2>
                            
                            <h3>Open Connect CDN</h3>
                            <p>Netflix's Open Connect is a custom-built Content Delivery Network designed specifically for delivering video content efficiently. Unlike traditional CDNs that serve a variety of content types, Open Connect is optimized solely for Netflix's video delivery needs.</p>
                            
                            <div class="image-container">
                                <div class="placeholder-image">
                                    <p>Netflix Open Connect Architecture Diagram</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="image-caption">Figure 2: Architecture of Netflix's Open Connect CDN.</div>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p><strong>Key aspects of Open Connect:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Appliance Placement</strong>: Netflix places Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) directly within Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks, as close as possible to end users.</li>
                                <li><strong>Content Distribution</strong>: Content is pre-loaded onto these appliances during off-peak hours, reducing bandwidth costs and improving streaming performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Intelligent Routing</strong>: Users are automatically directed to the closest available OCA that has the content they want to watch.</li>
                                <li><strong>Redundancy</strong>: Multiple OCAs serve the same content in different locations to ensure availability even if some appliances fail.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>This approach allows Netflix to deliver high-quality video with minimal buffering, even during peak usage times, while reducing transit costs for both Netflix and ISPs.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Microservices Architecture</h3>
                            <p>Netflix is known for pioneering the microservices architecture at scale. Their backend consists of hundreds of microservices, each responsible for a specific function.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Benefits of this approach for Netflix:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Independent Deployment</strong>: Services can be updated independently without affecting the entire system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Technology Diversity</strong>: Different services can use different technologies based on their specific requirements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Individual services can be scaled based on their specific load patterns.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resilience</strong>: Failures are isolated to specific services rather than bringing down the entire system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Team Autonomy</strong>: Small teams can own and operate their services independently.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Netflix has also developed and open-sourced several tools to support their microservices architecture, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Eureka</strong>: Service discovery server and client</li>
                                <li><strong>Hystrix</strong>: Latency and fault tolerance library</li>
                                <li><strong>Zuul</strong>: API gateway service</li>
                                <li><strong>Ribbon</strong>: Client-side load balancing</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Recommendation System</h3>
                            <p>Netflix's recommendation system is a critical component that helps users discover content they might enjoy from the vast catalog. It's estimated that about 80% of the content watched on Netflix comes from recommendations.</p>
                            
                            <p>The recommendation system uses a combination of approaches:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <h2>Fault Tolerance and Reliability</h2>
                            
                            <h3>Chaos Engineering</h3>
                            <p>Netflix pioneered the practice of Chaos Engineering, deliberately introducing failures in production to test system resilience. Their Chaos Monkey tool randomly terminates instances in production to ensure the system can handle such failures gracefully.</p>
                            
                            <p>Other tools in their "Simian Army" include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Latency Monkey</strong>: Introduces artificial delays to simulate service degradation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Conformity Monkey</strong>: Finds instances that don't adhere to best practices.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security Monkey</strong>: Identifies security vulnerabilities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chaos Gorilla</strong>: Simulates an entire AWS availability zone outage.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Circuit Breakers</h3>
                            <p>Netflix uses the circuit breaker pattern (implemented through Hystrix) to prevent cascading failures:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When a service dependency starts failing, the circuit breaker "trips" and stops sending requests to that dependency.</li>
                                <li>Fallback mechanisms provide alternative responses when a dependency is unavailable.</li>
                                <li>The circuit breaker periodically allows some requests through to check if the dependency has recovered.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Redundancy and Replication</h3>
                            <p>Netflix ensures high availability through multiple layers of redundancy:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Multi-AZ Deployment</strong>: Services are deployed across multiple Availability Zones within each AWS region.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Replication</strong>: Critical data is replicated across multiple storage systems and regions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stateless Services</strong>: Most services are designed to be stateless, making them easier to replicate and recover.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>
