                            <h3>Geospatial System</h3>
                            <p>The geospatial system is one of the most critical components of Uber's architecture. It needs to efficiently track the location of millions of drivers in real-time and find the nearest available drivers for a ride request.</p>
                            
                            <div class="image-container">
                                <div class="placeholder-image">
                                    <p>Uber Geospatial System Architecture</p>
                                </div>

                            </div>
                            
                            <p><strong>Key aspects of the geospatial system:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Geospatial Indexing</strong>: Uber uses specialized geospatial indexes to efficiently query for nearby drivers. They've developed a custom H3 hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Quadtree/Geohash</strong>: These data structures divide the world into hierarchical grid cells, allowing for efficient proximity searches.</li>
                                <li><strong>Location Tracking</strong>: Driver locations are continuously updated and stored in a distributed database optimized for geospatial queries.</li>
                                <li><strong>Geofencing</strong>: Defines virtual boundaries around real-world areas for features like airport queues, city boundaries, and no-pickup zones.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>This system allows Uber to quickly find the nearest drivers to a rider, typically in milliseconds, even with millions of drivers online simultaneously.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Matching System</h3>
                            <p>The matching system is responsible for pairing riders with drivers. It's not as simple as just finding the nearest driver; it considers multiple factors to optimize the overall marketplace efficiency.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Matching algorithm considerations:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: Distance between rider and driver.</li>
                                <li><strong>ETA</strong>: Estimated time for the driver to reach the pickup location.</li>
                                <li><strong>Driver Preferences</strong>: Some drivers may prefer certain types of trips or areas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rider Preferences</strong>: Vehicle type, accessibility requirements, etc.</li>
                                <li><strong>Driver Rating</strong>: Higher-rated drivers may be prioritized.</li>
                                <li><strong>Batching</strong>: In some cases, multiple ride requests may be batched together (like UberPool).</li>
                                <li><strong>Market Efficiency</strong>: Balancing individual matches with overall marketplace health.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The matching system must make these decisions in real-time, often within milliseconds, to provide a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Pricing System</h3>
                            <p>Uber's dynamic pricing system (often called "surge pricing") adjusts prices based on supply and demand. This helps balance the marketplace by incentivizing more drivers to come online during high-demand periods.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Key components of the pricing system:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Base Fare Calculation</strong>: Determines the standard fare based on distance, time, and service type.</li>
                                <li><strong>Demand Prediction</strong>: Uses historical data and machine learning to predict demand patterns.</li>
                                <li><strong>Supply Monitoring</strong>: Tracks the number of available drivers in different areas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Surge Multiplier</strong>: Calculates the price multiplier based on the supply-demand imbalance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Geospatial Segmentation</strong>: Applies different surge multipliers to different geographical areas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Time-based Variation</strong>: Adjusts pricing based on time of day, day of week, and special events.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The pricing system must be both responsive to real-time conditions and stable enough to avoid wild fluctuations that could confuse users.</p>

                            <h3>Asynchronous Processing</h3>
                            <p>Not all operations need to be processed synchronously. Uber uses asynchronous processing for many tasks:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Message Queues</strong>: Using Kafka for reliable message delivery between services.</li>
                                <li><strong>Event-driven Architecture</strong>: Services publish events that other services can subscribe to.</li>
                                <li><strong>Background Jobs</strong>: Processing non-critical tasks asynchronously to improve response times.</li>
                                <li><strong>Batch Processing</strong>: Aggregating and processing data in batches for efficiency.</li>

                            <p>Uber uses the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When a service dependency starts failing, the circuit breaker "trips" and stops sending requests to that dependency.</li>
                                <li>Fallback mechanisms provide alternative responses when a dependency is unavailable.</li>
                                <li>The circuit breaker periodically allows some requests through to check if the dependency has recovered.</li>
                            </ul>
