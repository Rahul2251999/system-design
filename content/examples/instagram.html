                            <p>Instagram is a popular photo and video sharing social networking service that allows users to upload media, which can be edited with filters and organized with tags and location information. Users can browse content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Instagram was launched in October 2010, acquired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012, and has grown to over a billion monthly active users.</p>
                            
                            <p>From a system design perspective, Instagram presents fascinating challenges due to its massive scale, media-heavy nature, and social networking features. The platform must efficiently store and serve billions of photos and videos while maintaining low latency and high availability for users worldwide.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Upload</strong>: User uploads a photo or video from the client application.</li>
                                <li><strong>Initial Storage</strong>: The media is temporarily stored in a staging area.</li>
                                <li><strong>Validation</strong>: The system validates the media format, size, and content.</li>
                                <li><strong>Processing</strong>: The media is processed in several ways:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Resizing: Multiple resolutions are generated for different devices and contexts.</li>
                                        <li>Filtering: If the user applied filters, these are processed.</li>
                                        <li>Compression: The media is compressed to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements.</li>
                                        <li>Metadata Extraction: Information like EXIF data is extracted.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Persistent Storage</strong>: The processed media is stored in a distributed object storage system.</li>
                                <li><strong>CDN Distribution</strong>: The media is distributed to CDN edge locations for fast access.</li>
                                <li><strong>Metadata Storage</strong>: Information about the media (user ID, timestamp, caption, location, etc.) is stored in a database.</li>

                            <p><strong>Key aspects of the media storage system:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Object Storage</strong>: Instagram likely uses distributed object storage systems like Amazon S3 or custom solutions built on top of it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Content-Addressable Storage</strong>: Media files might be stored using content-based addressing, where the file's hash serves as its identifier.</li>
                                <li><strong>Replication</strong>: Media is replicated across multiple storage nodes for durability and availability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tiered Storage</strong>: Different storage tiers might be used based on access patterns (e.g., hot storage for recent/popular media, cold storage for older content).</li>
                                <li><strong>CDN Integration</strong>: Media is served through CDNs to reduce latency for users worldwide.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Instagram's feed generation system is responsible for creating the personalized feed that users see when they open the app. This is a complex system that must balance performance, relevance, and freshness.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Feed generation approaches:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Push-based Model</strong>: When a user posts content, it's "pushed" to the feeds of all their followers. This approach provides fast feed retrieval but can be resource-intensive for accounts with many followers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pull-based Model</strong>: When a user requests their feed, the system "pulls" recent posts from all accounts they follow. This approach is more resource-efficient but can be slower for users following many accounts.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hybrid Model</strong>: Instagram likely uses a hybrid approach, where posts from regular users are pushed to follower feeds, while posts from high-follower accounts (celebrities, brands) are pulled at feed generation time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><strong>Feed ranking and personalization:</strong></p>
                            <p>Instagram's feed is no longer strictly chronological. It uses machine learning algorithms to rank posts based on various factors:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Interest</strong>: How likely the user is to be interested in the content based on past behavior.</li>
                                <li><strong>Recency</strong>: More recent posts are generally ranked higher.</li>
                                <li><strong>Relationship</strong>: Posts from accounts the user interacts with frequently are prioritized.</li>
                                <li><strong>Engagement</strong>: Posts with high engagement (likes, comments) may be ranked higher.</li>
                                <li><strong>Profile Visits</strong>: Content from accounts whose profiles the user visits frequently might be prioritized.</li>
                                <li><strong>Session Time</strong>: The algorithm might consider how long the user typically spends on Instagram.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Social Graph</h3>
                            <p>The social graph represents the relationships between users (who follows whom). This is a critical component that affects many aspects of the platform, including feed generation, recommendations, and privacy controls.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Key aspects of the social graph system:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Graph Storage</strong>: The social graph is typically stored in a graph database or a specialized data structure optimized for relationship queries.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bidirectional Indexing</strong>: The system maintains both "following" and "followers" indexes to efficiently answer queries like "Who does User A follow?" and "Who follows User A?"</li>
                                <li><strong>Caching</strong>: Frequently accessed portions of the graph are cached to reduce database load.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sharding</strong>: The graph is sharded (partitioned) across multiple servers to handle the massive scale.</li>
                                <li><strong>Privacy Controls</strong>: The graph system must respect privacy settings (e.g., private accounts, blocked users).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>To handle the massive scale of data, Instagram shards (horizontally partitions) its databases:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>User Sharding</strong>: Users are distributed across database shards based on user ID.</li>
                                <li><strong>Post Sharding</strong>: Posts are sharded based on post ID or user ID.</li>
                                <li><strong>Graph Sharding</strong>: The social graph is sharded to distribute the load.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Sharding allows Instagram to distribute the load across multiple database servers and scale horizontally as the platform grows.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Caching Strategy</h3>
                            <p>Caching is extensively used throughout Instagram's architecture to reduce database load and improve response times:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Feed Cache</strong>: Stores pre-computed feeds for users.</li>
                                <li><strong>User Cache</strong>: Caches user profile information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Post Cache</strong>: Caches frequently accessed posts and their metadata.</li>
