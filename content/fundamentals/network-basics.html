                            <p>Computer networks are the backbone of modern distributed systems, enabling communication between different components and services. Understanding networking fundamentals is crucial for effective system design, as network characteristics significantly impact system performance, reliability, and scalability.</p>
                            
                            <p>A computer network is a collection of computing devices connected together to share resources and communicate with each other. These connections can be physical (wired) or wireless, and can span anything from a small local area to the entire globe.</p>

                            <h3>IP Addressing</h3>
                            <p>IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network. They come in two main versions:</p>
                            
                            <div class="info-card">

                                </div>
                                <p>The older standard using 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1). With only about 4.3 billion possible addresses, IPv4 addresses are becoming scarce.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>The newer standard using 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv6 provides a vastly larger address space to accommodate the growing number of internet-connected devices.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>IP addresses can be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Public</strong>: Globally routable addresses visible on the internet</li>
                                <li><strong>Private</strong>: Used within local networks and not directly accessible from the internet</li>
                                <li><strong>Static</strong>: Permanently assigned to a device</li>
                                <li><strong>Dynamic</strong>: Temporarily assigned by a DHCP server</li>

                            <h3>Ports</h3>
                            <p>While IP addresses identify devices on a network, ports identify specific applications or services running on those devices. Ports are 16-bit numbers (0-65535) that enable multiple network services to operate on a single device.</p>
                            
                            <p>Common port numbers include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>80</strong>: HTTP (web)</li>
                                <li><strong>443</strong>: HTTPS (secure web)</li>
                                <li><strong>22</strong>: SSH (secure shell)</li>
                                <li><strong>25</strong>: SMTP (email sending)</li>
                                <li><strong>3306</strong>: MySQL database</li>
                                <li><strong>27017</strong>: MongoDB database</li>

                            <h3>DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>
                            <p>DNS translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other. This hierarchical, distributed system is crucial for the usability of the internet and networked applications.</p>

                            <p>Transport protocols operate at layer 4 of the OSI model and are responsible for end-to-end communication between devices. The two primary transport protocols are TCP and UDP, each with distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different use cases.</p>

                            <p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. It establishes a connection before data transfer and ensures all data arrives correctly.</p>

                            <h2>Network Performance Metrics</h2>
                            <p>Understanding network performance metrics is crucial for designing systems that meet performance requirements. Here are the key metrics to consider:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
                            <p>Bandwidth refers to the maximum rate of data transfer across a network, typically measured in bits per second (bps), with common units being Mbps (megabits per second) or Gbps (gigabits per second).</p>
                            
                            <p>Higher bandwidth allows for more data to be transmitted simultaneously, which is important for data-intensive applications like video streaming or large file transfers.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Latency</h3>
                            <p>Latency is the time it takes for data to travel from source to destination, typically measured in milliseconds (ms). It includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Propagation delay</strong>: Time for a signal to travel through the medium</li>
                                <li><strong>Transmission delay</strong>: Time to push all the packet's bits into the link</li>
                                <li><strong>Processing delay</strong>: Time for routers to process the packet header</li>
                                <li><strong>Queuing delay</strong>: Time the packet spends waiting in router queues</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Low latency is critical for real-time applications like video conferencing, online gaming, and financial trading systems.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Throughput</h3>
                            <p>Throughput is the actual rate of successful data transfer, which may be lower than the theoretical bandwidth due to various factors like protocol overhead, network congestion, and packet loss.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Packet Loss</h3>
                            <p>Packet loss occurs when data packets fail to reach their destination. It's typically measured as a percentage of packets lost relative to packets sent.</p>
                            
                            <p>Causes of packet loss include network congestion, hardware failures, and signal degradation. TCP automatically retransmits lost packets, while UDP applications must handle packet loss at the application level.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Jitter</h3>
                            <p>Jitter is the variation in latency over time. High jitter can cause problems for real-time applications, even if average latency is low.</p>
                            
                            <p>Applications like VoIP and video streaming often use jitter buffers to compensate for variable packet arrival times.</p>

                            <h3>Firewalls</h3>
                            <p>Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They can be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Network firewalls</strong>: Operate at the network level, filtering traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols</li>
                                <li><strong>Application firewalls</strong>: Operate at the application level, analyzing the content of traffic for specific applications</li>
                                <li><strong>Next-generation firewalls</strong>: Combine traditional firewall capabilities with advanced features like intrusion prevention and deep packet inspection</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</h3>
                            <p>VPNs extend private networks across public networks, enabling users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network. They provide:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Protecting data in transit</li>
                                <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Ensuring only authorized users can access the network</li>
                                <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Hiding the user's IP address and location</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>TLS/SSL</h3>
                            <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a network. They ensure:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Encrypting data to prevent eavesdropping</li>
                                <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Ensuring data hasn't been modified in transit</li>
                                <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Verifying the identity of communicating parties</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>HTTPS is HTTP over TLS/SSL, providing secure communication for web applications.</p>
                            
                            <h3>DDoS Protection</h3>
                            <p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks attempt to disrupt normal traffic to a service by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic from multiple sources. Protection strategies include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Traffic filtering</strong>: Identifying and blocking malicious traffic</li>
                                <li><strong>Rate limiting</strong>: Restricting the number of requests from a single source</li>
                                <li><strong>Anycast network</strong>: Distributing traffic across multiple data centers</li>
                                <li><strong>CDN</strong>: Using Content Delivery Networks to absorb traffic</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Network Considerations in System Design</h2>
                            <p>When designing distributed systems, several network-related factors should be considered:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Geographical Distribution</h3>
                            <p>The physical location of system components affects latency and availability. Options include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Single region</strong>: Lower latency within the region but vulnerable to regional outages</li>
                                <li><strong>Multi-region</strong>: Higher availability but increased complexity and potential consistency challenges</li>
                                <li><strong>Edge computing</strong>: Placing computation closer to users to reduce latency</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Network Partitioning</h3>
                            <p>Network partitions occur when network failures prevent nodes from communicating with each other. Systems must be designed to handle these situations gracefully, often involving trade-offs between consistency and availability (as described by the CAP theorem).</p>
                            
                            <h3>Protocol Selection</h3>

                                <li><strong>Real-time features</strong>: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events</li>
                                <li><strong>IoT devices</strong>: Lightweight protocols like MQTT</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Network Optimization</h3>
                            <p>Techniques to improve network performance include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</strong>: Distributing content closer to users</li>
                                <li><strong>Connection pooling</strong>: Reusing connections to reduce overhead</li>
                                <li><strong>Compression</strong>: Reducing the size of transmitted data</li>
                                <li><strong>Batching</strong>: Combining multiple requests or responses</li>
                                <li><strong>Asynchronous communication</strong>: Not waiting for responses before continuing processing</li>
