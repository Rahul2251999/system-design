                        <h2>What are Consistency Patterns?</h2>
                        <p>Consistency patterns define how and when data updates become visible to different parts of a distributed system. These patterns help system designers make appropriate tradeoffs between consistency, availability, and performance based on application requirements.</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <h3>Why Consistency Patterns Matter</h3>
                            <p>In distributed systems, achieving perfect consistency across all nodes while maintaining high availability and performance is challenging due to factors like network latency, partitions, and concurrent operations. Consistency patterns provide frameworks for managing these challenges by defining specific guarantees about how and when data updates propagate through the system.</p>
                            <p>Understanding different consistency patterns allows system designers to choose the most appropriate approach for their specific use case, balancing the need for data accuracy with performance and availability requirements.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>The Consistency Spectrum</h3>
                        <p>Consistency exists on a spectrum from strong to weak, with various models offering different guarantees:</p>

                        <div class="image-content-block">
                            <div class="image-block">
                                <img src="../../assets/images/consistency-spectrum.png" alt="Consistency Spectrum Diagram">
                            </div>
                            <div class="content-block">
                                <p>The consistency spectrum ranges from strong consistency (where all nodes see the same data at the same time) to eventual consistency (where nodes may temporarily see different values but will eventually converge).</p>
                                <p>Stronger consistency models typically offer better data accuracy but may sacrifice availability or performance. Weaker consistency models prioritize availability and performance but may allow temporary inconsistencies.</p>
                                <p>The diagram illustrates how different consistency models relate to each other in terms of strength of guarantees and typical performance characteristics.</p>

                            <h4>Linearizability (Strong Consistency)</h4>
                            <p>Linearizability is the strongest consistency model, providing the illusion that there is only a single copy of the data:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Once a write completes, all subsequent reads from any node will return the updated value</li>
                                <li>Operations appear to execute in a global, real-time order that matches their actual temporal order</li>
                                <li>Provides the most intuitive behavior but often with significant performance costs</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Sequential Consistency</h4>
                            <p>Sequential consistency ensures that operations appear to execute in some sequential order that is consistent with the order seen at individual nodes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>All nodes see operations in the same order (though not necessarily the real-time order)</li>
                                <li>Each node's operations appear in the order they were submitted</li>
                                <li>Slightly relaxes linearizability by not requiring the global order to match real-time order</li>

                            <p>Serializability guarantees that the execution of concurrent transactions is equivalent to some serial execution:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>Causal consistency ensures that operations that are causally related are seen in the same order by all nodes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If operation A happens before operation B (in a causal sense), then all nodes see A before B</li>
                                <li>Operations that are not causally related (concurrent) may be seen in different orders by different nodes</li>

                            <p>Algorithms that allow distributed nodes to agree on a single value:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Paxos:</strong> Classic consensus algorithm with complex implementation</li>

                                <li><strong>Zab:</strong> Used in ZooKeeper for atomic broadcast</li>

                                <li><strong>Saga Pattern:</strong> Sequences of local transactions with compensating actions</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Business requirements:</strong> What level of consistency does your application need?</li>
                                <li><strong>User expectations:</strong> What would users find confusing or problematic?</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance needs:</strong> What latency and throughput are acceptable?</li>
                                <li><strong>Availability requirements:</strong> Can the system tolerate downtime during partitions?</li>
                                <li><strong>Data characteristics:</strong> How frequently does the data change? How critical is it?</li>
                                <li><strong>Geographic distribution:</strong> Are users and data globally distributed?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Many systems use different consistency models for different operations or data types:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Strong consistency for critical operations (payments, bookings)</li>
                                <li>Weaker consistency for less critical operations (view counts, recommendations)</li>
                                <li>Tailored consistency models for specific data types (CRDTs for collaborative data)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This approach optimizes the consistency-performance tradeoff for each use case.</p>

                        <h3>Best Practices for Consistency Management</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Document consistency requirements</strong> for different parts of your system</li>
                            <li><strong>Choose the weakest consistency model</strong> that meets your requirements</li>
                            <li><strong>Design for conflict resolution</strong> from the beginning</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement monitoring</strong> to detect inconsistencies</li>
                            <li><strong>Test with network partitions</strong> to understand system behavior</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider versioning data</strong> to track changes and resolve conflicts</li>
                            <li><strong>Use idempotent operations</strong> where possible to simplify retry logic</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement compensating transactions</strong> for eventual consistency scenarios</li>
                            <li><strong>Educate users about consistency guarantees</strong> when relevant</li>
                            <li><strong>Regularly review consistency choices</strong> as system requirements evolve</li>
