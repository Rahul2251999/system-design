                        <h2>What is the CAP Theorem?</h2>
                        <p>The CAP Theorem, formulated by computer scientist Eric Brewer in 2000, states that a distributed data store cannot simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:</p>
                        
                        <div class="concept-card">
                            <h4>C - Consistency</h4>
                            <p>Every read receives the most recent write or an error. In other words, all nodes see the same data at the same time. Once a write is acknowledged to the client, all subsequent reads should reflect that write, regardless of which node they connect to.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="concept-card">
                            <h4>A - Availability</h4>
                            <p>Every request receives a non-error response, without guaranteeing that it contains the most recent write. The system remains operational and responds to client requests even if some nodes are down or experiencing issues.</p>

                            <p>The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication breakdowns between nodes). When a network partition occurs, the system must decide whether to cancel the operation (decreasing availability) or proceed with the operation (risking inconsistency).</p>

                            <h3>Why the CAP Theorem Matters</h3>
                            <p>The CAP Theorem is fundamental to distributed system design because it forces architects to make explicit choices about tradeoffs. In real-world distributed systems, network partitions are inevitable, making partition tolerance a necessity rather than an option. This effectively reduces the choice to consistency versus availability when a partition occurs.</p>
                            <p>Understanding these tradeoffs helps system designers make appropriate decisions based on business requirements, user expectations, and the nature of the data being managed.</p>

                                <h3>The CAP Tradeoffs</h3>
                                <p>Since partition tolerance is a necessity in distributed systems, the real choice is between:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):</strong> The system will return an error or timeout if it cannot guarantee consistency during a partition.</li>
                                    <li><strong>AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):</strong> The system will return the most recent available version of the data, which might not be consistent across all nodes.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The diagram illustrates how distributed systems must choose between these properties, with the understanding that only two can be fully achieved simultaneously.</p>

                            <h4>CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)</h4>
                            <p>CP systems prioritize consistency over availability during a partition:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When a partition occurs, the system may become unavailable for some operations</li>
                                <li>Once the partition is resolved, the system ensures all nodes have consistent data</li>
                                <li>Typically used for systems where data accuracy is critical</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Google Cloud Spanner:</strong> Uses TrueTime API and the Paxos algorithm to maintain strong consistency across global deployments</li>
                                <li><strong>Apache HBase:</strong> Provides strong consistency with a single master architecture</li>
                                <li><strong>MongoDB (with majority write concern):</strong> Ensures consistency by requiring acknowledgment from a majority of replicas</li>
                                <li><strong>Relational databases with synchronous replication:</strong> Ensure all replicas have the same data before confirming writes</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Use cases:</strong> Financial systems, inventory management, booking systems, and other applications where data inconsistency could lead to serious problems.</p>

                                <li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB:</strong> Provides eventual consistency by default, with an option for strong consistency</li>

                            <p>CA systems provide both consistency and availability, but only in the absence of partitions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>These systems cannot handle network partitions while maintaining both C and A</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Traditional relational databases:</strong> Single-node databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Use cases:</strong> Systems that can operate within a single location or with extremely reliable network connections.</p>
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> In a truly distributed environment, CA systems don't exist because partitions are inevitable. When a partition occurs, a CA system must sacrifice either consistency or availability.</p>

                            <p>Consistency isn't binary but exists on a spectrum:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Strong consistency:</strong> All reads reflect the most recent write</li>
                                <li><strong>Sequential consistency:</strong> All operations appear in the same order to all observers</li>
                                <li><strong>Causal consistency:</strong> Related operations appear in the same order to all observers</li>
                                <li><strong>Eventual consistency:</strong> Given enough time without updates, all replicas will converge</li>

                            <p>The PACELC theorem extends CAP by considering system behavior both during partitions and during normal operation:</p>

                                <li>All nodes must agree on account balances to prevent issues like double-spending</li>

                        <h3>Best Practices for CAP Decision Making</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Understand your data</strong> and its consistency requirements</li>
                            <li><strong>Segment your system</strong> and apply different CAP choices to different components</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider the business impact</strong> of both inconsistency and unavailability</li>
                            <li><strong>Design for partition recovery</strong> to minimize the duration of inconsistency</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement monitoring</strong> to detect partitions and inconsistencies</li>
                            <li><strong>Use compensation mechanisms</strong> to handle inconsistencies when they occur</li>
                            <li><strong>Document CAP decisions</strong> and their rationale for future reference</li>
                            <li><strong>Regularly review CAP choices</strong> as business requirements evolve</li>
                            <li><strong>Test partition scenarios</strong> to understand system behavior</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider the full spectrum of consistency models</strong>, not just the binary CAP choice</li>
