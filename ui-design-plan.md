# UI Design Plan for System Design Website

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive UI design plan for improving the System Design website. The plan is based on extensive research on UI/UX design principles, color schemes, typography, interactive elements, and accessibility guidelines for educational websites.

## Goals
1. Improve readability and user experience
2. Create a modern, visually appealing interface
3. Add interactive elements to enhance engagement
4. Ensure accessibility for all users
5. Maintain a consistent design across all pages
6. Complete all missing content

## Color Scheme

### Current Issues
- The current color scheme uses a combination of blue tones with accent colors that may not be optimized for readability
- Limited contrast in some areas
- Inconsistent application of colors across pages

### Proposed Color Scheme
Based on research on educational websites and readability, we'll implement the following color palette:

#### Primary Colors
- Primary Blue: #2D3E50 (dark blue - for headers and primary elements)
- Secondary Blue: #3498DB (medium blue - for interactive elements)
- Accent Color: #E74C3C (coral red - for call-to-action buttons and highlights)

#### Background Colors
- Light Background: #F8F9FA (off-white - main content background)
- Secondary Background: #EEF2F5 (light gray-blue - for cards and sections)
- Dark Background: #1A252F (deep blue-black - for footer and dark sections)

#### Text Colors
- Primary Text: #333333 (dark gray - for body text)
- Secondary Text: #6C757D (medium gray - for secondary text)
- Light Text: #FFFFFF (white - for text on dark backgrounds)

This color scheme follows the 60-30-10 rule:
- 60% - Primary background and neutral colors
- 30% - Secondary colors
- 10% - Accent colors for emphasis

The scheme provides high contrast for readability while maintaining a professional, educational appearance that's easy on the eyes during extended reading sessions.

## Typography

### Current Issues

  - H4: 1.25rem (20px)
- Body Text: 1rem (16px)
- Small Text: 0.875rem (14px)

#### Line Height and Spacing
- Body Text Line Height: 1.6
- Paragraph Spacing: 1.5rem
- Section Spacing: 3rem
- Content Width: Max 800px for optimal readability

#### Text Styling
- Headings: Bold (700)
